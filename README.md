**The ferret of the blackout**

A photo montage about recurrent power losses in Kalampaka due to ferrets

There is a well-known fact in the city of Kalampaka (Greece): ferrets are often causing blackouts.  
They enter in power substations, touch some wires and then... the whole region is in the dark.

I did this montage some time ago, from the famous Scorpions Blackout album.

In this repo, you will find the *GIMP project* and the *resource files*, if someone is interested in learning such montages.  
From a private joke to a kind of tutorial :)
